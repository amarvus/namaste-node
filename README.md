## 📘 What I've Learned So Far

I've been exploring the fundamentals of backend development and have gained a solid understanding of the following technologies:

### 🟩 Node.js
- Built-in modules and the event-driven architecture
- Understanding of the **V8 JavaScript Engine** that powers Node.js
- Knowledge of **libuv**, which handles asynchronous I/O and the event loop

### ⚙️ V8 Engine
- Compiles JavaScript into native machine code for fast execution
- Handles memory management and garbage collection

### 🔄 libuv
- Cross-platform C library behind Node.js
- Powers non-blocking I/O, file system operations, and the event loop

### 🛢️ MongoDB
- NoSQL database concepts
- Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
